## [0.0.2] - Add `showLabels` Toggle for Node Labels

### âœ¨ New Features
- Added `showLabels` boolean parameter to `InteractiveSankeyPainter` to enable or disable node label rendering.
- Exposed `showLabels` parameter through `buildInteractiveSankeyPainter()` and `SankeyDiagramWidget`, allowing label control at the widget level.

### ðŸ›  Enhancements
- Label rendering logic now respects the `showLabels` flag during painting.
- Improved flexibility for use cases where minimal or uncluttered visuals are preferred.
